# The extended line - maintainer's guide

How the **extended edition** ([EXTENDED_EDITION.md](EXTENDED_EDITION.md)) is kept next to the base project, written for whoever
continues the work (a person or another assistant instance) without the conversation that created it. Read
[MAINTAINING.md](MAINTAINING.md) first: its rules (no option = upstream 1:1, ask before outward-facing actions, privacy, formatting,
credentials) apply here unchanged. This page only adds what is specific to the extended line. State of 2026-09-30.

## 1. What it is and why it exists

The base project (`main`) is upstream's firmware plus 16 opt-in features. The extended line adds **19 more** opt-in features
(`webcal`, `multi-upload`, `source-auth`, `caldav`, `caldav-todo`, `agenda-rrule`, `upload-dedup`, `glyphs`, `info-screens`,
`chore-wheel`, `weather-screen`, `fact-of-the-day`, `finance-snapshot`, `fuel-prices`, `market-quotes`, `route-time`, `artworks`,
`schedule-pages`, `recipes`; bundle name **`extras`**) and one PC helper
(`scripts/fetch_art.py`). Decision of the maintainer (2026-09-30): these are **not merged into `main`** - the audience and target
hardware are small, the change is large, and only one board (Waveshare PhotoPainter 7.3") exists for testing. The line is published
next to `main` instead and kept in step with it.

It keeps every rule of the base: one build option per idea, no option = upstream byte-for-byte (proved by `alloff_source.py` and
`alloff_web.py`), releases are full builds. The 35 registry features and the bundle are checked by `scripts/test_features.py`.

## 2. Where everything lives

| What | Where |
| --- | --- |
| Base project (canonical) | `t3stier/esp32-photoframe-rebuild`, branch `main` - releases, update feed, web flasher of the **base** |
| Base project (mirror) | `t3ste/esp32-photoframe-rebuild` (Actions disabled) |
| **Extended repository** | `t3ste/esp32-photoframe-extras`, branch `main` = the extended line - **its own** releases, update feed and web flasher |
| Extended line, source only | branch `extras` in the canonical repository **and** in the mirror (no CI, no releases, no Pages) |
| Upstream (read-only) | `aitjcize/esp32-photoframe` |

Local checkout (`esp32-photoframe-fork`): the working branch is **`feature/ideas`** (the extended line). Remotes: `origin` = mirror,
`t3stier` = canonical, `extras` = the extended repository, `upstream` = aitjcize. The local branch `main` is the base.

Refspec map (what goes where):

```sh
git push t3stier feature/ideas:extras      # source branch next to main in the canonical fork
git push origin  feature/ideas:extras      # the same in the mirror
git push extras  feature/ideas:main        # the extended repository (its main)
```

Use `refs/heads/main` for the base in git commands - `main` alone is ambiguous because a directory `main/` exists.

**Why a repository of its own** (and not a second release line in the base repository): the frame's update check asks
`releases/latest` of the repository baked in at build time (`--ota-repo`), and `deploy-pages` force-pushes `gh-pages` on every
deploy. Two lines in one repository would offer each other's firmware to their frames and overwrite each other's web flasher.

### Accounts and credentials

As in MAINTAINING.md section 3: `gh` is logged in as `t3stier` and `t3ste`; the `t3ste` token lacks the `workflow` scope, so every
push that touches `.github/workflows/` must be made as `t3stier`. The extended repository belongs to `t3ste`; `t3stier` is a
collaborator with write access there. Push with the `gh` credential helper and the right account active:

```sh
gh auth switch --user t3stier
git -c credential.helper= -c "credential.helper=!gh auth git-credential" push <remote> <refspec>
```

Repository settings of the extended repository: Actions on; Pages from branch `gh-pages`, folder `/` (switch on after the first
successful `deploy-pages` has created the branch); **no** repository variable `OTA_REPO` (so the build bakes in the repository itself
as update feed - the base repositories set it to the canonical fork on purpose); no secrets; Issues on (hardware test reports).

## 3. Keeping it in step with `main`

Rules:

1. **The base is the source of truth.** A change that is useful for the base too (a fix in shared code, a doc correction) is made on
   `main` first, then merged here. Example: the Agenda timer fix exists as `3298659` on `main`; on this line it came earlier as
   `b95c483` and the comment text was then made identical (`21c8a7b`), so the merge has nothing to resolve in that hunk.
2. **Merge, do not cherry-pick**, in one direction: `git merge refs/heads/main` into `feature/ideas`. Nothing is merged from here to
   `main` except by a deliberate decision (single generic fixes go through `main`-first).
3. **Upstream goes into the base first** (MAINTAINING.md section 12), then into this line via the merge above. State on 2026-10-05:
   the base contains upstream v2.19.0 (`186ebaf`, merge `ae8c141`; the proofs' baseline moved to it) and this line contains the base - the merge of 2026-10-05 conflicted only in the changelog here. Before that, on 2026-10-01:
   the base contained upstream up to `f5e3ec9` (core dump partition on every layout, the last crash kept in NVS and shown in the
   Maintenance tab, ELF attached to releases) and this line contains the base. The first such round is the model: the three textual
   conflicts were `CHANGELOG.md` (keep both), `docs/MAINTAINING.md` (the test count - take the measured one) and
   `SettingsPanel.vue` (both blocks kept); the all-off proofs then moved to the new baseline on their own.

Procedure after the base changed:

```sh
git switch feature/ideas && git status                     # must be clean
git fetch --all --prune
git merge refs/heads/main                                   # resolve, see the hot spots below
# then the whole check set (section 5) - all must pass
git push extras feature/ideas:main                          # first: its CI is the real test
# after CI is green:
git push t3stier feature/ideas:extras && git push origin feature/ideas:extras
```

Conflict hot spots (both lines edit them): `CHANGELOG.md` (keep both entries in `[Unreleased]`), the feature tables in `README.md`
and `docs/FEATURES.md`, `main/Kconfig`, `main/feature_config.h` (the `FORK_ANY` list), `main/CMakeLists.txt`, `scripts/features.py`,
`scripts/migrate/xref.py` (`MODULES`), `host_tests/CMakeLists.txt` (`FORK_FEATURE_DEFS`), `Makefile` (the fork's test loop),
`.github/workflows/build.yml` (`feature_set`), `webapp/src/components/SettingsPanel.vue`, `webapp/src/stores/settings.js`,
`main/config_manager.{c,h}`, `main/config.h`, `main/http_server.c`, `main/utils.c`. The changes here sit in `#if FEATURE_X` blocks
and are additive, so a textual conflict usually means "both added lines at the same place: keep both".

## 4. Releases of the extended repository

- Releases are **full builds** of every board (`--all-features` = the base's 16 + these 14), as in the base. The workflow is the same
  file; the update feed is the repository itself.
- **Tags** `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`, numeric, in the repository's own sequence. `version_compare()` in `main/ota_manager.c` understands
  only three numbers and an `-rc<n>` suffix - a fourth number (`v218.7.0.1`) or another suffix would not be seen as a new version. Start
  from the base version the release contains; a second release on the same base bumps the patch. Say "extended edition" and the base
  version in the release notes.
- A **first release for any board that has not been flashed** is a pre-release (`-rc1` in the tag, the workflow turns that into a
  GitHub pre-release; frames on the pre-release channel get it).
- Procedure: `git tag -a vX.Y.Z -m "..."` on the extended repository's `main`, push the tag there **as `t3stier`**; the workflow builds
  16 firmware files, publishes them and redeploys the web flasher. Nothing is released from the source branches.
- The web flasher site is `https://t3ste.github.io/esp32-photoframe-extras/` (base path derived from the repository name by
  `SITE_REPO` in `webapp/vite.config.demo.js`; the deploy step passes `github.repository`).

## 5. The check set (what "good" means)

Run before every push (all green on 2026-09-30):

| Check | Command | Expected now |
| --- | --- | --- |
| C/C++ format | `clang-format-18 --dry-run --Werror` on `main/`, `components/`, `host_tests/` | clean |
| Web format, tests, lint | `cd webapp && npx prettier --check src && npx vitest run && npx eslint src` | 74 tests |
| Python format, tooling tests | `python -m black --check scripts build.py`, `python -m isort --check-only scripts`, `python -m unittest discover scripts -p "test_*.py"` | 94 tests |
| Host tests (WSL/Linux) | cmake `host_tests/`, build, `ctest` (serial - a few dedup tests collide in parallel) | 884 tests |
| Proofs | `alloff_source.py` (175 files), `alloff_web.py` (33 files), `web_bindings.py` (every feature set), `xref.py`, `check_capabilities.py` | 0 differences |
| Compile matrix | IDF shell: `python scripts/feature_matrix.py --board <b> extras all` for at least Waveshare, M5Paper and XIAO EE02 | OK |
| Firmware + flash | only with the maintainer's explicit OK, multi-part esptool command (MAINTAINING.md section 13) | |

Notes: the host tests fetch cJSON themselves when `managed_components/` is missing. After a feature matrix run,
`main/webapp` holds the last set's web bundle - regenerate it (`python build.py --board <b> --all-features --step webapp --step splash`,
outside the IDF shell) before a `--step firmware` build. A sporadic GCC internal compiler error in an IDF file is cured by running the
build again. `make` may not exist on Windows: run the parts by hand.

## 6. Where the knowledge is

- Per feature: `docs/<FEATURE>.md` (settings, limits, fixtures, how it was verified); for users
  [EXTRAS_USER_GUIDE.md](EXTRAS_USER_GUIDE.md); the option matrix in [FEATURES.md](FEATURES.md); the changelog.
- What the display looks like: [SCREENSHOTS.md](SCREENSHOTS.md) and `docs/screens/`, with made-up data - no real names, places or calendars in a picture. The
  information pages come from `host_tests/render_screens.cpp` (commands in that page); the Agenda pictures from a small program that is deliberately not in the
  repository (the maintainer keeps their helper files local) - redraw them whenever the look of a page changes.
- Fixtures of real service answers: `host_tests/data/{ecb,tankerkoenig,market,caldav,...}` with a README each (no secrets; invented data).
- Design notes per page: the information pages are pure drawing functions (`main/screen_*.c`, host-tested for five panel sizes, pictures
  via `host_tests/render_screens.cpp`); data fetching lives in `info_screens.c` / `market_service.c`; settings in `config_manager.c`,
  `http_server.c`, `utils.c`, `SettingsPanel.vue`, `settings.js` - follow the `fuel-prices` or `market-quotes` commit as the template for a new page
  ("Checklist for adding a build feature" in MAINTAINING.md section 5).

## 7. Open items (what has not been seen on real hardware)

Only the Waveshare PhotoPainter 7.3" was flashed. Not done, and how to check:

| Item | Check |
| --- | --- |
| Other boards (M5Paper first: plain ESP32, no PSRAM assumptions; flash-only XIAO: index files on internal flash; the two 16-grey and the big panels) | flash a full build, tick each page, upload a batch, run a duplicate index; look at colours/greys |
| `market-quotes` with personal Twelve Data / Alpha Vantage keys, Yahoo over days at a short schedule, a wake without network, the quota counter, the 12 KB wake-task stack with a page, the look on the e-paper | real keys, a day of the debug log, unplug the network once |
| `artworks`: **seen on 2026-10-02 (Waveshare)**: the three museums over TLS, decode and conversion, the album, the caption overlay drawn. **Not seen**: the clean-up on a full card, the caption on 16-grey panels, no network -> album, a day of rotation, the Smithsonian demo key's quota, how the panel looks (scale *cover* crops portrait pictures hard) | set Auto Rotate to *Artworks*, watch the log for a day; unplug the network once; fill the storage |
| `route-time`: **seen on 2026-10-03 (Waveshare)**: the endpoints, the Web UI card, the requests to TomTom and HERE with a key that no service knows (both answered "invalid key", the frame continued from one to the other), a fuel page with the option on but unchecked; **with a real TomTom key (same day)**: the address look-up, the check of both ways and the fuel page taking the travel time (the frame's log). **HERE**: the maintainer tried a real key and reports that it works (not in the part of the debug log that was read: HERE is asked only when TomTom fails). **Not seen**: the red block on the panel (nothing was over the limit), the provider terms (attribution, caching); the test answers are still assembled from the providers' documentation | the page in a jam; record real success answers as fixtures (needs a key outside the frame - the frame's key is write-only) |
| The Agenda tab as a list of sections: **seen on 2026-10-03 (headless Chrome against the Waveshare frame, and served by it)**: closed at first, headers with the state, a page's settings only while ticked, the Calendar's options only while it is on, remembered sections, 390 px wide, seven feature combinations at runtime. **Not seen**: Safari and Firefox, a real phone, touch use | open the tab on a phone and in the other browsers |
| `schedule-pages`: **seen on 2026-10-03 (Waveshare, USB powered)**: four overlapping schedules drew the right pages, held-off fires neither drew nor woke the frame (awake path), the rotation was planned past a held-off fire, the Web UI loads, moves and saves pages, holds and order. **Not seen**: the deep-sleep wake path of a battery frame (the same functions, but `main.c` classifies the wake), the rotation fire itself held off, a day of overlapping schedules. **Seen on 2026-10-04 (Waveshare, USB powered)**: a schedule's page that is not ticked under Information screens falls back to the shared rotation and comes back when ticked again; ToDo & Calendar without a tick of its own (a schedule given only that page draws nothing with ToDo and Calendar off, and draws as soon as ToDo is on); a schedule whose pages are all unavailable no longer wakes the frame (no log entry at its time); the Recipe page stays in a schedule's list; the Web UI's disabled Schedule section and the warning for a page that no schedule draws (headless Chrome) | a battery frame with deep sleep on, two schedules a few minutes apart, the log of the wakes |
| `recipes`: **seen on 2026-10-03 (Waveshare, USB powered)**: the Chefkoch recipe of the day (classic, vegan), a Chefkoch search with filters, TheMealDB by category and at random, landscape and portrait, the QR code, a page without a picture, the relaxation of the filters after three empty tries (`6 tries, filters relaxed, 8 requests`, warning "Filter gelockert"), the last recipe with its warning when the source gave no usable answer (an invalid TheMealDB key), the Web UI card and the API round trip (umlaut values, values outside the lists ignored, the key write-only), the stack (at least 8 KB of the 16 KB free in the rotation task) and the memory. **Audited 2026-10-03** (static warnings, review, fuzzer; the findings were fixed, see CHANGELOG; the decoder library's 32-bit size wrap in the base's photo pipeline is fixed there too, under `fixes`, see CHANGELOG). **Not seen**: the page on a deep-sleep wake (the wake task), no network at all (the message page / the skipped page), other boards and panels (sixteen grays, 1872 x 1404, 960 x 540, the small panels' text size), a long run, Chefkoch's interface over weeks (it is unofficial and can change), TheMealDB with a personal key, a phone reading the QR code from the panel. **Found while testing it, and fixed (`main/tls_ca_cb_fix.c`):** every TLS connection of a build with `agenda` leaked 200-400 bytes of internal heap - the cross-signed verification of the certificate bundle (switched on for Google Calendar) leaves name buffers that mbedtls does not free. A frame that sleeps never noticed (every wake starts afresh); an always-on one lost about 1 KB a minute with a page a minute. Verified on the frame: the heap trace shows no certificate allocation, the free heap stays level over 11 requests, the verification result is the same for normal, cross-signed and refused hosts. **Not yet seen:** a long always-on run (a day) with the Agenda and a page, to confirm the free heap stays level there too; the same fix belongs in `main` (its `agenda` option sets the same sdkconfig line) | see [RECIPES.md](RECIPES.md) |
| `fuel-prices` with a personal Tankerkoenig key (only the public demo key was used) | real key, a real place in Germany; keep the schedule >= 5 minutes (the service asks for it) |
| `caldav` / `caldav-todo` against Nextcloud, Baikal, iCloud-like servers; long task lists; `source-auth` Digest/https on a real server | see the per-feature docs |
| Web UI in Safari/Firefox/Android | batch upload uses `CompressionStream`/`DecompressionStream` |
| The second audit's fixes (`fixes`): **seen on 2026-10-04 (Waveshare, plain HTTP and real Chrome)**: a foreign `Origin` refused with 403 on GET/POST/DELETE (also `null` and a look-alike host), `Origin` = `Host` (with and without the default port) passes, the frame's own Web UI and the colour editor's *Send to device* work, the settings POST caps and a round trip of the real settings, the OTA check with the `https://` rule, a crafted profile file runs nothing. **Not seen**: Firefox/Safari sending a cross-site POST (Chrome stopped it before the frame - its local-network protection), a reverse proxy that rewrites `Host`, the Home Assistant integration and the phone app against a `fixes` build (they send no `Origin`, so no change is expected), DNS rebinding (not covered, see section 12) | with a proxy: keep the original `Host`; with another browser: a page on another origin that `fetch`es a `POST` to the frame must get 403 |
| A photo read that fails halfway (`fixes`, base and here): **seen on 2026-10-05 (Waveshare)**: the normal path (full decode, panel update, "displayed successfully") with the fix built in, and the Telegram token and chat ID no longer in `GET /api/config` or in the Web UI fields (read-only checks: the real credentials were not touched). **Not seen**: the failure branch itself - the sequential and random rotation going on after a failed read (the one-off SD error that found the bug cannot be provoked; code review only), the Remove buttons of the Telegram fields against real credentials | an SD card that fails reads (a worn or badly seated one) and the log: `BMP read incomplete` followed by `trying the next image instead` / `recovered by displaying` |
| Import of a config exported by an older build | export, import into a build without the new keys: unknown keys must be ignored |
| CI on the extended repository | the first runs may show timing/resource problems (8 boards x plain/full, feature-compile matrix) |

## 8. Ideas that were decided against or left for later

- **Not built:** tree/bird/dinosaur "of the day" packs (the content does not exist in the repository and cannot be generated by
  code; the picture part would need a JPEG-into-canvas path) and the newsstand (needs WebP; the ESP registry has no decoder; front pages
  are copyrighted, and the one free JPEG source found serves *progressive* JPEGs that the firmware's decoder - baseline only - cannot read).
- **Alternatives worked out** (none started): a tiny "daily content" feed that a scheduled job publishes (an image or a text per day,
  per board) for the frame's existing URL rotation mode - needs a date placeholder in the image URL (~0.5 day); "picture of the day =
  album image number (day mod count)"; the fact list fetched from a URL instead of uploaded; fact/bird packs generated by a PC script from
  Wikipedia summaries (CC BY-SA, attribution needed).
- **Symbol alias table for markets** (a JSON file mapping Yahoo symbols to the other sources' vocabulary): judged not stable enough - the
  pattern rules would need an interpreter, the proxies (futures -> spot, index -> ETF) change the level of a price, forex history must be
  `FX_DAILY` (not `CURRENCY_EXCHANGE_RATE`, which has no history), and Twelve Data's non-US `mic_code` could not be verified with the public demo
  key. Worth doing later, in stages: table-driven mapping equal to today's behaviour, Alpha Vantage crypto via `DIGITAL_CURRENCY_DAILY`
  (verified live) and currency pairs via `FX_DAILY` (verified live), then Twelve Data suffixes with a real key and a "plan not sufficient" status.
- **Markets input:** only the first four symbols are used and the rest is ignored silently - a hint next to the field would help.
- **Fuel prices:** a fallback provider is of little value (all providers carry the same MTS-K data). kraftstoffbilliger.de has a JSON API but
  gives keys on request only; TankPuls' documented API answered 404 on 2026-09-30 and the service is not on the Bundeskartellamt's list of
  approved providers. The MTS-K itself is only available to approved consumer-information services via the Mobilithek (XML containers, a
  server-side job). A better safeguard: keep the last good list on the storage and show it with the "Stand" note, and a 5-minute minimum between fetches.
- **Stale sentence** in `docs/CALDAV_TODO.md`: it says umlauts become ae/oe/ue; with `glyphs` (always present where `info-screens` is) they are real glyphs.

## 9. Pitfalls collected on the way

- A shell heredoc can turn `'\0'` into a real NUL byte and backslash escapes into characters when a patch script is passed through a
  tool - write patch scripts as files (an editor/`Write` tool) and run them.
- `git add -A` picks up new build directories; list them in `.git/info/exclude` first (`build-*`, `build-matrix`).
- `make` is not installed on the maintainer's Windows machine; the CI steps are run by hand (table in section 5).
- Flashing the merged image at offset 0 erases settings - use the part-wise command. A frame that is unreachable: check once and ask.
- The test frame's settings must be snapshotted and restored around live checks (schedule, ticked pages, language, keys); never leave demo
  keys or a demo place on it.
- `git log --format=%h main..feature/ideas` is ambiguous (directory `main/`); write `refs/heads/main`.
- Never echo a key; the firmware never logs keys or login URLs, tests check this.

## 10. How it was set up (2026-09-30) and what to check

Done, in this order: `main` (with the Agenda timer fix `3298659`) pushed to the canonical fork and the mirror; the repository
`t3ste/esp32-photoframe-extras` created (public, topics `esp32 e-paper photoframe firmware`, label `test-report`, `t3stier` added as a
collaborator with write access and the invitation accepted); the line pushed as its `main` (commit `ee91b86` of the local `feature/ideas`);
its first CI run passed (**CI: format, 681 host tests, tooling; Build Firmware: the 16 firmware builds, all feature compiles and the deploy - 82 jobs green,
the release job skipped as it should**); GitHub Pages switched on (branch `gh-pages`, folder `/`) and checked: `https://t3ste.github.io/esp32-photoframe-extras/`
serves the landing page with the extended repository's name in its links and the web flasher manifests; finally the line pushed as branch `extras` to
the canonical fork and the mirror.

**First release, 2026-10-01:** after the base had merged upstream `f5e3ec9` and this line had merged that `main` (commit `4c763dc`; checks of
section 5 all green, CI and Build Firmware green on the extended repository), the tag `v218.7.1-rc1` was pushed there as `t3stier`. The
workflow built the 16 firmware files and the 8 ELF files and created a draft; its title and notes (English: why a pre-release, what is in
it, web flasher link, manual flashing, the OTA/`coredump` remark) were set by hand and the draft published as a **pre-release**. Releases
of this repository are the only ones whose OTA feed a frame running this firmware asks. The next release on the same base: `v218.7.1-rc2`,
or the final `v218.7.1` (no suffix - `version_compare()` sorts it above its release candidates) once a board other than the Waveshare was
flashed and reported; a new base version gets its own numbers.

**Second candidate, 2026-10-02:** `v218.7.1-rc2` on the same base, tagged on the extended repository's `main` after the check set and both CI runs were green. It adds the artworks mode
(run on the Waveshare only, in short sessions - so it stays a **pre-release**), the clearer markets / exchange-rate / fuel pages (trading day in the header, one-line footer) and the Fit /
orientation settings of the artworks mode. Same procedure: tag as `t3stier`, the workflow builds the draft, title and notes by hand, then published as a pre-release.

**Third candidate, 2026-10-03:** `v218.7.1-rc3` on the same base (the base `main` now also has the TLS heap-leak fix). It adds the recipe page, the travel time on the fuel page, the pages per
Agenda schedule, the restructured Agenda tab of the Web UI and the TLS fix. All of these ran on the Waveshare only (USB powered, short sessions), so it stays a **pre-release**; section 7 lists what
has not been seen. The base was fixed first (`main` 323341d, CI and Build Firmware green), merged here, the check set run (all green: 1037 host tests, the proofs, the compile matrix for Waveshare,
M5Paper and XIAO EE02), the extended repository's CI and Build Firmware green, and then tagged. Same procedure: tag as `t3stier`, the workflow builds the draft, title and notes by hand, then published.

**Fifth candidate, 2026-10-05:** `v218.7.1-rc5` on the same base. After rc4 (the two code audits) it adds: the Telegram bot token and chat ID are write-only (they were returned in plaintext by `GET /api/config`; fixed in
the base first, with the fetch-error clean-up on a mode change); a photo whose read fails halfway is no longer shown as a half-blank picture (base `fixes`, found on a frame: one-off SD error); the
schedule-pages precision work (a schedule only draws pages that are available, ToDo & Calendar has no tick of its own, a schedule whose pages are all unavailable does not wake the frame, a warning for a page that
no schedule would ever draw, the Recipe page could not be assigned to a schedule because of a 7-bit mask); and two defects of the `fixes` option that upstream's maintainer found when reviewing our pull request (upstream closed it on 2026-10-05 after taking five of its six fixes into v2.19.0): a JPEG with two frame headers could still be decoded past its buffer (the header walk of upstream's `jpeg_header.c`, identical file) and a rejected WiFi change answered 200 success. Procedure as before: base `main` first (three commits `911454d`, `00640bb`, `0829c82`), merged here, the check set
run (1101 host tests, the proofs, the web and Python checks, the compile matrix for Waveshare, M5Paper and XIAO EE02), the extended repository's CI and Build Firmware green, then the tag as `t3stier`, the draft
and its notes by hand. **After this candidate was tagged (still a draft, not published)** the maintainer decided to merge **upstream v2.19.0** into the base: done on 2026-10-05 (base `ae8c141`; see CHANGELOG and section 3), the redundant `fixes` copies were dropped. The draft of rc5 therefore held the older 218 base. **Decided by the maintainer on 2026-10-05: the rc5 draft and its tag were discarded** (release and tag deleted in this repository, never published); the next pre-release is made on the new base - by MAINTAINING.md section 12 point 5 the base's next release is `v219.0.0`, and this repository's own sequence starts over for a new base version (`v219.0.0-rc1`).

**Sixth candidate, 2026-10-05:** `v219.0.0-rc1` on the new base (`main` = `v219.0.0`, which contains upstream v2.19.0). It is rc5's content on the new base - the Telegram fields write-only, the half-read photo, the schedule-pages work, the two `fixes` defects found in upstream's review - plus what the new base brings (upstream's WiFi policy, crash reports in every build, the demo package, the removal of the two `wifi-resilience` settings upstream's policy made inert). The check set was run on the merged line (1101 host tests, the proofs, the web and Python checks, the compile matrix for Waveshare, M5Paper and XIAO EE02 with the extras and all features), the firmware was flashed to the extended-line test frame and the demo package was tested on it (MAINTAINING.md section 16), the base was released first (`v219.0.0`), then this line was merged and tagged. Same procedure: tag as `t3stier`, the workflow builds the draft, title and notes by hand, then published as a pre-release.

**`v219.0.0-rc1` was withdrawn on the same evening (set back to a draft), together with `v218.7.1-rc3` and `-rc4` and the base's `v219.0.0`.** Every full build crashed on its HTTPS requests: `main/tls_ca_cb_fix.c` (added in rc3 against a heap leak per TLS connection) freed buffers of the certificate that ESP-IDF's certificate bundle returns, and the CI image's newer ESP-IDF (`v6.0.3-489`, the branch `release-v6.0`) no longer allocates them, while the local ESP-IDF 6.0.0 still does - so every local test passed. It showed as "Failed to check for updates: Failed to fetch" in the Web UI on the maintainer's frame (crash record: `free() target pointer is outside heap areas`, task `ota_check_task`; decoded with the release's ELF). Fixed in the base first (`b3f901b`, a guard that repacks only certificates that own their buffers); MAINTAINING.md section 7 and 15 say what to do about the two ESP-IDF versions. **Seventh candidate, 2026-10-05:** `v219.0.1-rc1` on the base `v219.0.1` - the content of `v219.0.0-rc1` with the fix. Before the tag the **CI build of the commit** (not a local one) was flashed to the test frame and the update check run seven times (200 each, no new crash record); the extended repository's CI and Build Firmware were green. The notes are those of `v219.0.0-rc1` with the fix notice on top.

**Seventh candidate, 2026-10-05:** `v219.0.1-rc1` on the base `v219.0.1` (the base's `v219.0.0` withdrawn, `v219.0.1` with the TLS fix published). It replaces the withdrawn `v219.0.0-rc1`, `v218.7.1-rc3` and `-rc4`; same procedure,
published as a pre-release the same evening. **Eighth candidate, 2026-10-10:** `v219.0.1-rc2` on the same base. It adds the option `agenda-rrule` (libical, see [CALENDAR_RRULE_ENGINE.md](CALENDAR_RRULE_ENGINE.md)) and the Agenda's
repeat fixes of the base's `main` (DST on the wall clock, `EXDATE`/`RDATE`/`RECURRENCE-ID`, `DURATION`, the earliest 48 events). Checked first: the check set, the compile matrix, CI and Build Firmware green on the extended repository, the
CI-built Waveshare image flashed and used; then the tag as `t3stier`, the draft, its title and notes by hand (kept in the maintainer's `local-tools/scratch/rc2_notes.md`), and - after the maintainer's go - published as a pre-release;
the web flasher's pre-release manifest then showed it. Afterwards the reader's own DAILY/WEEKLY expander was compiled out of builds with the option (`c0800c6`, not in rc2, no change of results). Not seen yet: a run of days, any other board.
**Ninth candidate, 2026-10-10:** `v219.0.2-rc1` on the base `v219.0.2` (released the same day, fixes only). Compared with rc2 it adds the compiled-out reader expander (`c0800c6`) and the base's fixes since `v219.0.1`: the config answer that names
the fields the frame ignored, the Web UI without internet access (icons and font bundled), the import messages, the gallery and upload fixes, the Settings export in a build with the Agenda but without `fixes`. Checked first: the check set, CI and Build
Firmware green on both repositories, the CI-built Waveshare images of the base and of this line flashed part by part (crawl of the Web UI, the import/export/upload flows, the config answers, the update check three times); then the tag as `t3stier`,
the draft, its notes by hand, and the publication as a pre-release. Still not seen: a run of days, any other board.

Quick check that everything is still in step: `git ls-remote t3stier`, `git ls-remote origin` and `git ls-remote extras` must show the same commit for
`refs/heads/extras` (first two) and `refs/heads/main` (the third); the base `refs/heads/main` of the first two is the base.

## 11. A fresh checkout (another machine or instance)

```sh
git clone https://github.com/t3ste/esp32-photoframe-extras.git esp32-photoframe-fork && cd esp32-photoframe-fork
git remote rename origin extras
git remote add t3stier  https://github.com/t3stier/esp32-photoframe-rebuild.git
git remote add origin   https://github.com/t3ste/esp32-photoframe-rebuild.git
git remote add upstream https://github.com/aitjcize/esp32-photoframe.git
git fetch --all --prune
git branch main t3stier/main                   # the base project
git switch -c extras extras/main               # the extended line; the original machine calls this branch feature/ideas
```

On such a checkout use `extras` where this page says `feature/ideas` (`git push t3stier extras:extras`, `git push extras extras:main`). Tools as in
MAINTAINING.md (ESP-IDF 6.0, Node 20, Python with black/isort, clang-format 18, WSL or Linux for the host tests, `gh` logged in with both accounts).
The maintainer's test frame is not reachable from another machine; hardware items in section 7 need him.

## 12. Code audits and the standing security rules

Two audits were run (2026-10-03: the recipe page and the TLS fix; 2026-10-04: everything this repository changed against upstream
`f5e3ec9`). Their reports are in the maintainer's git-ignored `local-tools/audit/`; what they found is fixed and described in
`CHANGELOG.md` and `docs/FIXES.md`. Rules that came out of them - keep them when adding code:

- **Every route is registered with `register_uri()`** (it puts the optional password gate and the cross-site check in front);
  never call `httpd_register_uri_handler()` directly. A receiver reads a **capped** body (`content_len` checked before any
  allocation) and reads until it is complete.
- **No `innerHTML` / `v-html` with data** in any page (the Vue app has none; `public/profile-editor.html` is a hand-written page
  that is served by the frame, so script in it can call the whole API - texts go in with `textContent`, imported colours are
  validated). A page the frame serves is trusted with every secret the API returns.
- **Data from the internet is untrusted**: bounded sizes before allocating (a decoder's own size arithmetic is not - see
  `jpeg_size_check.h`), `https://` only for anything that fetches code or pictures, file names from remote IDs through a
  character whitelist, JSON nesting limited before cJSON parses it.
- **The Origin check** (`main/http_origin.h`, `fixes`) stops a web page on another site from posting to the frame. It does **not**
  stop DNS rebinding (a foreign name that points at the frame); only the device password does. A host allow-list was left out on
  purpose: it would lock out everyone who reaches the frame by a name of their own router (`photoframe.fritz.box`). If it is
  ever added it needs a setting for the extra names. Without a password `GET /api/config/urls` hands out the calendar addresses
  and API keys - documented in `docs/API.md` (Access control).
- Observations left as they are on purpose: the certificate date check of the recipe fetches, the global cJSON nesting limit
  (1000, the recipe code limits itself to 32), unlocked statics read by one task, no overall deadline per request, a
  non-atomic write of the last-recipe file, and the Jest test chain's npm advisories (not shipped).
- The 15 speech samples of the keyword tests are Windows text-to-speech output; `host_tests/data/kws/README.md` says what was
  checked about them (the licence terms were not) and why an eSpeak set does not drop in.

## 13. Keeping this page true

Update section 2 when a repository or branch moves, section 5 when counts change, section 7 when something has been verified on hardware,
and section 3 after every upstream merge. The maintainer's private planning notes (`IDEAS.md`, git-ignored) may exist on his machine; nothing in
them is needed to continue - this page and the feature documents carry everything.
